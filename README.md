# cppPlay
Created this project to brush up on my c++ skills. 

I have not written c++ in a while, and 
decide to create a project that exercises my coding skills

when i was in school git did not exist, when i joined industry cvs was used. 

I am not sure if people still use makefiles any more

Also, my github address was requested to attend a meetup, so it seems proof of my ability to write code is currency these days so this is another reason for this project . basically i needed code that I wrote , i choose c++ because i felt c++ is a harder language because it is unmanaged code so maybe my knowledge of memory management is more worth more than coding in managed code. I will add another project in managed code as well

I will probably start off with some data structures and string manipulation 


also, i only plan on using vi as my IDE, maybe that is more impressive LOL
